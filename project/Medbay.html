        from 50%
        in 2019. Challenges included limited appointment availability, difficulties finding in-network providers, and
        the length

        might not be in the medical profession or have access to doctors as easily as others do. Medbay has a one-page
        spread on
        how to find out if you have Covid-19 and how to book an appointment. The website also has a list of FAQs on the
        page.

      <h1>The Results</h1>
      <p>
        Medbay helped me to learn more about JavaScript and AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML). I learned to create
        dynamic
        sections to load up the data without reloading the whole page. Creating animations using JavaScript. Also
        explored PHP,
        creating databases and filling up the data using forms on the website. Displaying the filtered data with the
        help of
        AJAX and PHP. Also, discovered how to add 360-degree media to the website. Creating a login page for the doctors
        and
        writing the blogs which are posted in real-time. Created sessions and cookies to keep their login even if they
        reload
        the page.
